	abstract = {One weakness of batteries is the rapid falloff in charge-storage capacity with increasing charge/discharge rate. Rate performance is related to the timescales associated with charge/ionic motion in both electrode and electrolyte. However, no general fittable model exists to link capacity-rate data to electrode/electrolyte properties. Here we demonstrate an equation which can fit capacity versus rate data, outputting three parameters which fully describe rate performance. Most important is the characteristic time associated with charge/discharge which can be linked by a second equation to physical electrode/electrolyte parameters via various rate-limiting processes. We fit these equations to {\textasciitilde}200 data sets, deriving parameters such as diffusion coefficients or electrolyte conductivities. It is possible to show which rate-limiting processes are dominant in a given situation, facilitating rational design and cell optimisation. In addition, this model predicts the upper speed limit for lithium/sodium ion batteries, yielding a value that is consistent with the fastest electrodes in the literature.},

	abstract = {Conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are composed of planar stacks of anodes, cathodes, and separators, all immersed in electrolyte and sandwiched between current collectors. However, planar LIBs have a performance trade-off where increasing electrode thickness leads to higher capacity but lower rate capability. Three-dimensional (3D) batteries circumvent this issue with 3D electrode architecture. Herein, we systematically analyze 3D LIBs from experimental publications over the past 20 years. Using a previously developed empirical model, we obtain parameters to quantify the rate capability and rate-limiting mechanisms of 3D LIBs. Compared to conventional LIBs, 3D LIBs exhibit better rate capability─confirming their expected performance benefit. To provide further insight, we investigate the impact of liquid-phase and solid-phase diffusion mechanisms on this performance benefit. Lastly, we discuss the design landscape of 3D LIBs across multiple electrode designs and material sets and highlight our perspective on the applicability of 3D LIBs at different application scales.},
